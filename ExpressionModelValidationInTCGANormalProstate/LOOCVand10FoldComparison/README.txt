Comparison of imputed expression using `Prostate_Thibodeau.db` (+- 500kb window, LOOCV, using dbGaP training data from Mayo Clinic)
  vs. `Prostate_Thibodeau.10foldCV.db` (also +- 500kb window, also dbGaP training data, but using 10-fold Cross Validation) databases.
Parametric --> using linear regression (equivalent to Pearson's correlation)
Nonparametric --> also uses Spearman's rank correlation, making no distributional assumptions
