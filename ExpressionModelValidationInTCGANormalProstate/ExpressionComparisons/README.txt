Comparison of imputed expression using `Prostate_Thibodeau.db` (using dbGaP training data from Mayo Clinic)
  vs. `TW_Prostate_0.5.db` (from GTEx v6p prostate PredictDB) databases.
Parametric --> using linear regression (equivalent to Pearson's correlation)
Nonparametric --> also uses Spearman's rank correlation, making no distributional assumptions
